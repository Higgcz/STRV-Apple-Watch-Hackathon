STRV Apple Watch Hackathon
===
STRV is hosting Apple Watch Hackathon, it is one-day challenge and I'm proud I can be part of it.

This project is created as a result of our team efforts.

Unfortunately we didn't have to much time for preparation, so we're starting from scratch in a day of Hackathon.

Ideas
---
- application for quick overview of public transport arriving to the nearest stop
- simple foreign language learning app - the application will send user a notification with two phrases / words, one in his language and the other in chosen foreign language. User has to decide if the one phrase / word is the translation of the other one.
- glance with anytime recommendation for a movie based on user's watchlist
