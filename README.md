STRV Apple Watch Hackathon
===
STRV is hosting Apple Watch Hackathon, it is one-day challenge and I'm proud I can be part of it.

This project is created as a result of our team efforts.

Unfortunately we didn't have to much time for preparation, so we're starting from scratch in a day of Hackathon.

*"Never Miss the Train Again"*

Final idea!

Application presenting you the nearest train information table, you can then select a train you want to track and get notification from. Notification are sended when the train is delayed, or when it knows on what rail the train is comming.

We came up with this idea really late, so we didn't have time to to make the entire app, so at the end we prepare just some concept screens and prototype of UI.

Old Ideas

- application for quick overview of public transport arriving to the nearest stop
- simple foreign language learning app - the application will send user a notification with two phrases / words, one in his language and the other in chosen foreign language. User has to decide if the one phrase / word is the translation of the other one.
- glance with anytime recommendation for a movie based on user's watchlist
